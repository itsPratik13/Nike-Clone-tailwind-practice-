tailwind has predefined attributes. for specifying your own use []
ex: text-lg  ----> predefined 
    text-[50px] ----> custom

                absolute: moves like a piece of puzzle , anywhere
                fixed: locked  even after scrolling
                sticky: acts like sticky note after scrolling    

display: ----->      
assets in src folder 
for all exports put them in a folder. ex: components , put them in components folder, make an index.js, export from there, same goes for constants
hamburger should be visible only when navbar not visible, so always hidden, then if width= mobile screen then block display

map function is important. 
make an index.js for constants
max-sm:...... for smaller devices
sm---> small devices
max-sm:  extra small devices

whichever things get re-rendered make them components:  ie reload karne ke baad ya click karne ke badd
